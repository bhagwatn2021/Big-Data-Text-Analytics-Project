Yang Qi was staking everything on one move, and used the most powerful tactic he could think of.
He had exchanged life for life, something that he couldn’t even do with the God Legion Seal.
Injuring Eunuch Sunflower and Zilin, he pushed himself to his ultimate limit and took the godhood.
Powering the snake that was King Heaven-Devourer with everything he could muster, he sent it to simply gobble it up.
The power of the godhood was immense, but Yang Qi had been confident all along that he would be able to take it.
However, as soon as it was devoured by the snake, he suddenly sensed a powerful expression of will bursting out of it.
It was the will of a god that could shake heaven and earth, and it instantly caused King Heaven-Devourer’s talismans to begin to crack and crumble.
Extending his hand, he sent a drop of blood into the talismans, godmammoth blood that, as soon as it reached the snake, unleashed a might that corresponded to the saying snakes devour mammoths.
As a result, the snake stopped crumbling and actually grew dozens of times more powerful than before.
Swallowing the godhood, it then turned and headed toward the vortex leading to the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart.
